## General Cljs aims

bc I don't want 

- separate processes/jvms for things that can run in one jvm 
- yet more config files - prefer clojure data to config shadow & kaocha 

what I do want 

- a Clojure repl (& to be able to enter and quit cljs repls from that)
- ability to stop/start any servers etc running in that
- trigger test runs (Clojure and Cljs) from Clojure repl  

## Testing aims 

- run tests under advanced compilation
